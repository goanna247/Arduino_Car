# Arduino_Car
Uses a L298N motor driver and an arduino uno. 
also has a remote control and a 3 colour LED. 

was built for mod time engineering. 
has 1 file to define functions (directions and LED colours) 
and main calls these functions. 

todo list 
- remote control file 
- more LEDs to indicate duration of driving 
- add speed control
- line following

might turn some of these functions into a library because why not, also lots of people get stuck at the coding stage.
